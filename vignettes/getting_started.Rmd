# Introduction

Uncertainty in age estimates needs to be accounted for when undertaking stock 
assessments. Punt et al. (2008) provides methods for estimating ageing error
matrices that account for both ageing bias and imprecision. We provide some 
documentation and examples of the Template Model Builder (TMB) implementation 
these methods, incorporating documentation written by André Punt.

This vignette is illustrated using data and settings associated with three stocks in the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) fishery (Blue Grenadier, Bight Redfish, and School Whiting), as well as sablefish from the U.S. west coast.

# Software

The current implementation of the software was written by André Punt in 2020 and
subsequently updated in 2022. There are several slightly different versions of 
the source code in circulation, we use the version maintained by Kelli Johnson
(NOAA NWFSC). We have consulted with André Punt and agreed that future 
development of the ageing error code should be done through the NWFSC GitHub
repository.

## Ageing Error R package

The NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) GitHub site hosts the 
`AgeingError` package. The newer TMB version of the software replaced the ADMB 
version in the main branch of the repository in May 2024. The ADMB version is 
still available via the git history.

You can install the TMB branch directly from GitHub using the code below. Note
both TMB and Rtools need to be installed to do this.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("pfmc-assessments/AgeingError")
```

The package can then be loaded. 

```{r}
library(AgeingError)
```

The software requires the data and model are specified using input files which 
are described below.

# Input files

There are two input files needed to run the software the data file (.dat 
extension) and the specifications file (.spc extension). These are described 
below using Blue Grenadier (BG2022) as the example.

## Data file

The data file (.dat extension) contains the age comparison data by pair of
readers and specifies the range of ages permitted in the data, the minus and
plus groups and the reference age. The data file comprises two or more sections
(the age range then one section for each data pair of reader comparisons)

The age range is simply specified by providing the minimum and maximum ages. 
The data can't fall outside the specified age range or the code will generate 
an error.

The input files are parsed by the software using keywords that need to match 
exactly what is expected, so the text "Range_of_ages" is part of the input and
not just a comment to help the user keep track of the format.

````{verbatim}
Range_of_ages
0 25
````

The data can be entered with a separate data set for each pair of readers, or
a single data set for all pairs of readers. Both these options are described 
below.

### Separate Data Sets

For each pair of readers (often the first and second reads by the same reader)
there is one section with the header `Data_set_x` (x=1, 2, etc). The four lines
immediately below the header are

* The number of rows of paired age determinations (described below)
* The number of readers in this data set (always 2 for the SESSF)
* The minus group, plus group, and reference age
* The reader numbers

The remainder of the data set comprises one row of data for each pair of age
determinations with the following format. The columns for each reader (1-6) 
represent an age, while the left most column represents the number of times 
that pair of ages were assigned by the two readers. The columns for the other 
readers (if any) need to be filled with `-999`.

````{verbatim}
Data_set_1
141     # number of lines
2       # Number of readers
1 20 5  # minus group; plus group; reference age
        1     2     3     4    # Which readers   
9       0     0   -999   -999
1       0    10   -999   -999
153     1     1   -999   -999
25      1     2   -999   -999
...
2      23    23   -999   -999
1      24    23   -999   -999
2      24    24   -999   -999
1      25    24	  -999   -999

````

A second (and potentially a third) data set follow the same format as the first 
data set, with the data being associated with the next pair of readers (see 
below). The headers for each data set need to have headers numbered from 1 to 
`NDataSet` which is an input to `CreateData()`. That is, if `NDataSet=3`, the 
data file needs to have sections with header `Data_set_1`, `Data_set_2`, and
`Data_set_3`. 

````{verbatim}
Data_set_2
123     # number of lines
2       # Number of readers
1 20 5  # minus group; plus group; reference age
        3     4     1     2 # which readers
27      1     1   -999   -999
13      1     2   -999   -999
3       2     1   -999   -999
227     2     2   -999   -999
...
2      22    20   -999   -999
1      22    21   -999   -999
1      23    21   -999   -999
1      23    22   -999   -999
````

### Combined Data Set

The alternative to having separate data sets for each pair of readers is to 
combine multiple pairs of readers in a single data set as shown below. For this
format the number of readers is now 4 and the data for the second pair of readers
follows on from the end of the first pair.

````{verbatim}
Data_set_1
264     # number of lines
4       # Number of readers
0 25 5  # minus group; plus group; reference age
        1     2     3     4 # Which readers   
9       0     0   -999   -999
1       0    10   -999   -999
153     1     1   -999   -999
30      1     2   -999   -999
...
1      24    23   -999   -999
2      24    24   -999   -999
1      25    24   -999   -999
27   -999  -999     1     1
13   -999  -999     1     2
3    -999  -999     2     1
...
2    -999  -999    22    20
1    -999  -999    22    21
1    -999  -999    23    21
1    -999  -999    23    22
````

### Other Considerations

Note that the ages need to be whole numbers in the data file. The C++ code adds 
0.5 to each age so the model it fitting to the midpoint of an age bin.

Different agencies have created R code specific to the format of their ageing
comparison data to format it for this package. For instance CSIRO 
uses the R package `SESSFdataproc` and hosts examples are in the assessment
repository `SESSFassessments`. A version of this code is available from CSIRO. 
They usually create the data file in Excel (using the summarised output from the 
R code) and then paste into a text file.

The data file is read into R
using the function `CreateData()` which is described in the examples below.

## Specifications file

The age-estimates for at least one of the age-readers must be assumed to be 
unbiased (sensitivity to the choice of this age-reader should be examined if 
there is uncertainty about which age-reader is most likely to be unbiased). 
The options for bias and precision are described below and entered into the 
specifications file (.spc extension), an example of which is provided after the 
description of the model options.

### Bias options

The available options for bias are:

* `-x` Assume that the relationship between expected age and true age is the same as that for reader x. [Note that the ''x'' must be lower than the number of the reader for which bias is being defined. Reader 2 can have `BiasOpt=-1` to match reader 1].

* `0`  Age-estimates are unbiased.

* `1` The expected age of an animal of age $a$, $E_a$, is a linear function of its true age, i.e. $E_a =\alpha a$ (constant coefficient of variation).

* `2` The expected age of an animal of age $a$, $E_a$, is a given by: 

$$E_a = E_L + (E_H - E_L)\frac{1-\text{exp}(-\beta(a-1))}{1-\text{exp}(-\beta(a_{max}-1))}$$.

The C++ code (`AgeingError.cpp`) also has conditional (if) statements for Bias 
options 4 and 5 but these are identical to option 0 (unbiased) and therefore presumably placeholders for some future options.

In the SESSF we typically assume that all readers are unbiased (`BiasOpt=0`),
however, it is important to check this assumption using the residual plots 
(André Punt pers. comm.)

### Sigma options

The available options for random ageing precision are:

*	`-x`. Assume that the relationship between the variance of age-reading error and true age is the same as that for reader x [note that ''x'' must be lower than the number of the reader for which bias is being defined].

*	`1` This option assumes a constant coefficient of variation, it has one parameter that needs to be specified for each pair of independent readers in the specification (.spc) file. The standard deviation of random age-reading error, $\sigma_a$, is a linear function of true age, i.e.: 

$$ 
  \sigma_a = 
  \begin{cases}
    \gamma & \text{if  } a=0 \\
    \gamma a & \text{otherwise} \\
  \end{cases}
 $$ 

*	`2` The parameters relate to the standard deviation (Michaelis-Menten equation). This option has three parameters that need to be specified for each pair of independent readers in the specification (.spc) file. The standard deviation of random age-reading error, $\sigma_a$, is given by:

$$ 
  \sigma_a = 
  \begin{cases}
    \sigma_L + (\sigma_H - \sigma_L)\frac{1}{1-exp(-\delta(a_{max}-1))}   & \text{if  } a=0 \\
    \sigma_L + (\sigma_H - \sigma_L)\frac{1-exp(-\delta(a-1))}{1-exp(-\delta(a_{max}-1))} & \text{otherwise} \\
  \end{cases}
$$ 


* `3` The parameters relate to the coefficient of variation (Michaelis-Menten equation). This option has three parameters that need to be specified for each pair of independent readers in the specification (.spc) file. The coefficient of variation of random age-reading error, $CV_a$, is given by: 

$$ 
  CV_a = 
  \begin{cases}
    CV_L + (CV_H - CV_L)\frac{1}{1-\text{exp}(-\delta(a_{max}-1))}   & \text{if  } a=0 \\
    CV_L + (CV_H - CV_L)\frac{1-\text{exp}(-\delta(a-1))}{1-\text{exp}(-\delta(a_{max}-1))} & \text{otherwise} \\
  \end{cases}
 $$ 

*	`4` The estimates of age are exact (use this option for ''known age'' individuals). This option returns a vector of zeroes (or perhaps just a single zero).

*	`5` The standard deviation of random age-reading error, $\sigma_a$, is a spline function of age (a Forsythe, Malcolm, and Moler type spline as implemented by `tmbutils::splinefun()`). The number and location (ages) of the knots must be specified, with the number of parameters equal to the number of knots. Bounds and initial parameters need to be specified in log space.

*	`6` The standard deviation of random age-reading error, $\sigma_a$, is a piecewise linear function of age.  The number and location (ages) of the knots must be specified, with the number of parameters equal to the number of knots. Bounds and initial parameters need to be specified in log space.

* `7` A linear change in the standard deviation of random age-reading error, $\sigma_a$, with age. This option has two parameters that need to be specified for each pair of independent readers in the specifications (.spc) file. 

* `8` A linear change in the coefficient of variation of random age-reading error, $CV_a$ , with age. This option has two parameters that need to be specified for each pair of independent readers in the specifications (.spc) file.

### Example Specifications file

The .spc file contains three or four sections: 
1. reader specification, 
2. knots for splines or breakpoints for piecewise linear functions (if used), 
3. bias parameters, and 
4. the sigma parameters.

The first section specifies the Bias and Sigma options for each reader. For each
reader, one line specifies their Bias and Sigma options. `SigmaOpt=-x` is used
to assume the relationship between expected age and true age is the same as that 
for reader x [note that the `x` must be lower than the number of the reader 
for which bias is being defined].

The example below (from Blue Grenadier) shows two pairs of readers (1-2 & 3-4)
who are all specified to be unbiased (`BiasOpt=0`) with readers 1 and 2 having 
the same ageing precision `SigmaOpt=2`. This model requires three parameters to 
be specified (presumably $\sigma_L$, $\sigma_H$, and $\delta$) for each pair of
readers (in the case of Blue Grenadier the first and second reads from two readers).

````{verbatim}
# reader BiasOpt SigmaOpt 
       1       0        2            
       2       0       -1            
       3       0        2             
       4       0       -3 
````

The second (optional) section species the knots for the spline and linear 
interpolation models. The example below is taken from School Whiting (`WHS2.spc`).
It specifies five knots with the first and last knots being the minimum and
maximum ages. Note that the text "# Spline specifications" or "# Linear specifications" are required by the code if SigmaOpt options 5 or 6 are used.

````{verbatim}
# Spline specifications
5
0 3 5 7 9

# Linear specifications
5
0 3 5 7 9

````

The next section specifies conditions under which the Bias parameters are 
estimated. We need to provide the bounds, initial values and whether the 
parameter should be estimated (1) or pre-specified (0) at the initial value.
If `Bias=0` (the case for SESSF stocks) this section is blank (NULL), although 
we retain the heading (not sure if the heading is needed). The Sablefish example
(Sable.spc) provides an example of how to implement bias within ageing error 
estimation.

````{verbatim}
Bias_Pars (low high init, on/off)  
````

The final section specifies conditions under which the Sigma parameters are 
estimated. Like above, we need to provide the bounds, initial values and whether
the parameter should be estimated (1). One set of parameter bounds, initial
values and on/off needs to be provide for each group of readers that assume the
same ageing uncertainty (group of `x/-x`).  In the example below
(`SigmaOpt=2`) there are three parameters for each pair of readers.

````{verbatim}
Sigma_Pars (low high init, on/off)  
    0    1   0.2   1    # Readers 1 & 2
 0.01    1   0.2   1
    0    2   0.5   1
    
    0    1   0.2   1    # Readers 3 & 4  
 0.01    1   0.2   1
    0    2   0.5   1
````

# Examples

For the examples we focus on SESSF species, which all specify (`BiasOpt=0`). If
bias in the age readings is suspected, an example of how to implement bias 
within ageing error estimation is provided in the Sablefish example (Sable.spc).

## Blue Grenadier

Blue Grenadier (_Macruronus novaezelandiae_) is deep water species caught by
trawl in south eastern Australia (Tuck and Bessell-Browne 2022). It has age
readings from two separate 
readers who have each re-read their own reads (i.e. there are no inter-reader 
comparisons in the production data). In 2022, estimating ageing error for Blue
Grenadier was challenging, requiring removal of problematic data, different 
models for each reader and improvements to the model source code. We work 
through this example below.

The function to load the data file into R isn't currently exported from the 
ageing error R package so we need to use `:::` to access it. Note we are using
the data file with a single data set so we set `NDataSet=1`.

```{r}
data_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "AgeingError")
BG2022_dat <- AgeingError:::CreateData(file.path(data_dir, "BG2022.dat"), NDataSet=1, 
                                       verbose=TRUE, EchoFile="BG2022echo.out")
```
When we set `verbose=TRUE` a summary of the loaded data is printed to the console.
Check that the this matches with the input file, some things that are worth 
checking include,

* The last line of each data set.

* The total number reads for each reader pair.

* The number of readers and their order.

* The plus, minus and reference ages.

There's a warning about potentially missing data, this occurs when there are 
ages below the minimum age and above the maximum age, however, the warning does
not appear to be correct in this case. Possibly the `-999` values in the data are
causing the warning because they are <0.

Next we load the model specifications using the `CreateSpecs` function. This 
function is not exported either so again we need to call the package name and
`:::` to access it. 

```{r}
BG2022_spc <- AgeingError:::CreateSpecs(file.path(data_dir, "BG2022.spc"), DataSpecs=BG2022_dat, 
                                       verbose=TRUE)
```

The function creates a nested list with one list element for each reader in the 
data. By setting `verbose=TRUE`, the list will print to the console and you can
check that the inputs have been read in correctly. Note a reader that has a `-x`
for the Sigma option (i.e. the relationship between expected age and true age
is the same as that for reader x) will not have parameter values. The output from
this function varies with the model that is specified (i.e. the knots will all be 
zero unless a spline or piecewise linear model is specified - sigma options 5 and 
6).

Ageing error is the estimated using the function `DoApplyAgeError`. This 
function is exported from the R package so can be called directly. We need to
provide a name (`Species` argument), the data, model specs, specify the weights
(`AprobWght` and `SlopeWght`) and the name of a subdirectory to save the output 
(it gets created if it doesn't exist). We set `verbose=FALSE` in this example as
a large amount of output is printed to the screen. 

<!-- The output of this function isn't useful, set results="hide" -->
```{r, results="hide"}
BG2022_mod <- AgeingError::DoApplyAgeError(Species = "BG2022",
                                           DataSpecs = BG2022_dat,
                                           ModelSpecsInp = BG2022_spc,
                                           AprobWght = 1e-06,
                                           SlopeWght = 0.01,
                                           SaveDir = "Results",
                                           verbose = FALSE)

```

The model is stored as a list in the object `BG2022_mod` and this
information along with the data and model specifications is saved in the output
directory as an lda file with name `Species` (in this case "BG2022.lda").

Examine the structure of the model object

```{r}
str(BG2022_mod)
```

We then save the model output using the `ProcessResults` function, again using
`:::` as this function also isn't exported. We want to specify that the effective
sample size is estimated (`CalcEff = TRUE`) as this produces the fits to the 
individual data points which can be used to identify outliers that may be 
impacting model convergence. The model creates several output files that contain
the ageing error estimates and the information we need to assess the fit so we 
set `verbose = FALSE`. 

This following files in the output subdirectory (in this case `Results`).

* The report file (.rpt extension) which contains the convergence criteria, model specifications, parameter estimates with their uncertainty and ageing error matrices for each reader (note readers with bias or sigma option `-x` will be identical to reader `x`).

* An LDA file (.lda extension) containing the data and model specifications.

* One csv file (.csv extension) for each reader that contains the estimated standard deviation and coefficient of variation for each age  (note readers with bias or sigma option `-x` will be identical to reader `x`).

* A series png file (.png extension) that contain plots of the data and model residuals.

```{r}
BG2022_out <- AgeingError:::ProcessResults(Species = "BG2022", SaveDir = "Results", CalcEff = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
```

An examination of the report file (`BG2022.rpt`) shows the maximum gradient is
-93.96, indicating the model has not converged. Ideally the gradient should be
between $\pm \text{1e-4}$  and zero, however, in practice achieving this for some models
can be very time consuming and involves removing progressively more data so we 
sometimes accept a gradient ~$\pm \text{1e-3}$. 

The residual plots show a large number of outliers exceeding the 95%
confidence interval and the table of fits to the individual data points (bottom
of the report file (only present when `CalcEff = TRUE`) shows a number of 
data points with predicted values of 0 (or very close to zero e.g. 10e-10), see
line 2 below (extracted from the report file).

````{verbatim}

Data_set Group Group Line Readers Obs  Obs_Numbers Pred_Numbers

````

To get closer to a converged model it was necessary to undertake data trimming  
(removing observations values with predicted values of 0), specify a 
different ageing error model for the second reader and prespecify (i.e. fix)
one of the parameters for the second reader. This was done in a stepwise manner,
with small changes being made, the model run and the results examined before more
changes were made until we achieved a final model we considered acceptable. 

We refit the final model (`BG2022_trim_8_1`).

Load the data file.

```{r}
BG2022final_dat <- AgeingError:::CreateData(file.path(data_dir, "BG2022_trim_8_1.dat"),
                                            NDataSet=1, verbose=TRUE,
                                            EchoFile="BG2022finalecho.out")
```

Note the number of lines of data has been reduced from 264 to 252. 

Next we load the model specifications. For the second reader (3 and 4 in the 
data) we have specified a linear change in the standard deviation of random 
age-reading error (`SigmaOpt=7`) and fixed the first parameter at 0.2.


```{r}
BG2022final_spc <- AgeingError:::CreateSpecs(file.path(data_dir, "BG2022_trim_8_1.spc"),
                                             DataSpecs=BG2022final_dat, 
                                             verbose=TRUE)
```

We run the final model.

<!-- The output of this function isn't useful, set results="hide" -->
```{r, results="hide"}
BG2022final_mod <- AgeingError::DoApplyAgeError(Species = "BG2022_trim_8_1",
                                           DataSpecs = BG2022final_dat,
                                           ModelSpecsInp = BG2022final_spc,
                                           AprobWght = 1e-06,
                                           SlopeWght = 0.01,
                                           SaveDir = "Results",
                                           verbose = FALSE)
```

As with the earlier model we save the results.

```{r}
BG2022final_out <- AgeingError:::ProcessResults(Species = "BG2022_trim_8_1", SaveDir = "Results", CalcEff = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
```

This model is now close to convergence (gradient = -0.00143) and residual plots 
do not show any concerning features and the estimates of ageing error standard
deviation are increasing with age.

## Bight Redfish

Bight Redfish (_Centroberyx gerrardi_) is a long-lived species caught by 
trawl in the Great Australian Bight (Curin-Osorio and Burch 2022). It has age 
readings from three separate readers who have each re-read their own reads (i.e.
there are no inter-reader comparisons in the data). 

```{r}
REB2022_dat <- AgeingError:::CreateData(file.path(data_dir, "REB2022.dat"), NDataSet=1, 
                                       verbose=TRUE, EchoFile="REB2022echo.out")
```

We check the summary above against the information in the data file. There don't
appear to be any problems, however, we are still getting the warning about 
missing data.

Next we load the model specifications using the `CreateSpecs` function. 

```{r}
REB2022_spc <- AgeingError:::CreateSpecs(file.path(data_dir, "REB2022.spc"),
                                         DataSpecs=REB2022_dat, verbose=TRUE)
```

For Bight Redfish we fit a one parameter model assuming the expected age is a
linear function of the true age. We assume there is no inter-reader variability 
(all readers have the same ageing uncertainty as reader 1). Note that because we
have specified all readers have the same ageing uncertainty (readers 2--6 have 
`SigmaOpt=-1`), we only need to provide one line of sigma parameters.

We estimate ageing error for Bight Redfish. 

<!-- The output of this function isn't useful, set results="hide" -->
```{r, results="hide"}
REB2022_mod <- AgeingError::DoApplyAgeError(Species = "REB2022",
                                            DataSpecs = REB2022_dat,
                                            ModelSpecsInp = REB2022_spc,
                                            AprobWght = 1e-06,
                                            SlopeWght = 0.01,
                                            SaveDir = "Results",
                                            verbose = FALSE)

```

We then save the Bight Redfish model output.

```{r}
REB2022_out <- AgeingError:::ProcessResults(Species = "REB2022", SaveDir = "Results", CalcEff = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
```

An examination of the report file (`REB2022.rpt`) shows the maximum gradient is
0.0221, indicating the model has not quite converged. 

We remove four outliers with probability <1e-5 and also start the model at the 
estimated value of the CV (0.0413288). We save the revised data and model
specifications as (`REB2022_trim.dat` and `REB2022_trim.spc`) and rerun the 
model (note we suppress the creation of output in this document).

<!-- set results="hide" -->
```{r, results="hide"}
REB2022_dat2 <- AgeingError:::CreateData(file.path(data_dir, "REB2022_trim.dat"), NDataSet=1, 
                  verbose=FALSE, EchoFile="REB2022_trimecho.out")
REB2022_spc2 <- AgeingError:::CreateSpecs(file.path(data_dir, "REB2022_trim.spc"),
                  DataSpecs=REB2022_dat2, verbose=FALSE)
REB2022_mod2 <- AgeingError::DoApplyAgeError(Species = "REB2022_final",
                  DataSpecs = REB2022_dat2, ModelSpecsInp = REB2022_spc2,
                  AprobWght = 1e-06, SlopeWght = 0.01, SaveDir = "Results",
                  verbose = FALSE)
REB2022_out2 <- AgeingError:::ProcessResults(Species = "REB2022_final", 
                  SaveDir = "Results", CalcEff = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)

```


The final gradient is -0.001973, close to convergence.

## School Whiting 

School Whiting  (_Sillago flindersi_) is a short-lived species caught by Danish 
seine and trawl in south eastern Australia (Day et al. 2020). This species
provides an example of a data file with three separate data sets and a spline
model. 

Load the School Whiting data file, make sure to set the number of data sets to 
three (`NDataSet=3`).

```{r}
WHS2_dat <- AgeingError:::CreateData(file.path(data_dir, "WHS2.dat"), NDataSet=3, 
                  verbose=TRUE, EchoFile="WHS2echo.out")
```

Make sure to check the summary above against the values in the data file.

Load the specifications for School Whiting.

```{r}
WHS2_spc <- AgeingError:::CreateSpecs(file.path(data_dir, "WHS2.spc"),
                  DataSpecs=WHS2_dat, verbose=TRUE)
```

For School Whiting we fit a spline function (`SigmaOption=5`) with five knots
(0, 3, 5, 7, and 9). Note the initial parameter values are in log space.

Fit the ageing error model and save the results

<!-- Set results="hide" -->
```{r, results="hide"}
WHS2_mod <- AgeingError::DoApplyAgeError(Species = "WHS2",
                  DataSpecs = WHS2_dat, ModelSpecsInp = WHS2_spc,
                  AprobWght = 1e-06, SlopeWght = 0.01, SaveDir = "Results",
                  verbose = FALSE)
WHS2_out <- AgeingError:::ProcessResults(Species = "WHS2", 
                  SaveDir = "Results", CalcEff = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
```


The maximum gradient is ~2.3-05 indicating the model has converged. The estimated
standard deviation by age shows the ageing uncertainty increasing from age 0
to age 4, then declining for ages 5 and 6 before increasing substantially for 
ages 7--9. The fits at the far right hand side of the age distribution are 
poor and there is little data to inform the model in this region. The 
appropriateness of this model should be discussed with the ageing technicians.

## Sablefish

Sablefish (_Anoplopoma fimbria_) provides an example of using the bias option.

```{r}
Sable_dat <- AgeingError:::CreateData(file.path(data_dir, "Sable.dat"), NDataSet=1, 
                                      verbose=TRUE, EchoFile="SableEcho.out")
```

We check the summary above against the information in the data file. This data
set has several inter-reader comparisons.

We load the model specifications using the `CreateSpecs` function. 

```{r}
Sable_spc <- AgeingError:::CreateSpecs(file.path(data_dir, "Sable.spc"),
                                         DataSpecs=Sable_dat, verbose=TRUE)
```

The Sablefish example fits three separate series (1-2, 3-4 & 5-6). The model 
assumes the following:

Bias Options: Reader 5 is unbiased, readers 1 & 2 have the same constant bias, 
reader 6 has a separate constant bias while the bias of readers 3 & 4 is the 
same and follows a Michaelis-Menten relationship. In the specifications file 
the first list relates to the constant bias of readers 1 & 2, the next three 
lines readers 3 & 4, while the final line specifies the constant bias of reader
6. Reader 5 is assumed to be unbiased and therefore doesn't require parameters
to be specified.

Sigma Options: Readers 1 & 2 assume the same linear relationship (constant CV),
while readers 5 & 6 have a separate linear relationship. Readers 3 & 4 assume
ageing uncertainty follows a Michaelis-Menten relationship. The parameters are
specified in the same manner as for the bias option (above).

The code below can be used to fit the Sablefish ageing error model. We don't 
run it because this particular model is very slow.

<!-- We don't run this code -->
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## run the Sablefish model
Sable_mod <- AgeingError::DoApplyAgeError(Species = "Sable",
                                          DataSpecs = Sable_dat,
                                          ModelSpecsInp = Sable_spc,
                                          AprobWght = 1e-06,
                                          SlopeWght = 0.01,
                                          SaveDir = "Results",
                                          verbose = FALSE)
## save the model results
Sable_out <- AgeingError:::ProcessResults(Species = "Sable", SaveDir = "Results", CalcEff = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
```

# Trouble Shooting

Some suggestions for getting to a converged model are provided below.

* Vary the initial values of the parameters in the specifications file.

* For models that are close to convergence, re-run the model using the estimated parameters as the initial values.

* Problematic data can be identified from the residual plots and at the bottom of the report file with prediction probabilities <1e-5. Removing data with low probability can improve the fit.

* There may not be sufficient data to estimate ageing error for multiple combinations of readers, the data can be pooled to estimate fewer parameters (bias / sigma option `-x`)

* The model may not be appropriate, select a different model based on the residual plots.

* Prespecify (fix) one or more parameters for a pair of readers.
