# nwfscAgeingError 1.0.1

The version used for the 2017 assessment cycle.

# nwfscAgeingError 1.0.0

The version used for the 2013 assessment cycle. Though the repository was not
tagged until 2015. Melissa Haltuch noted that in 2014 the code was updated and
a summary of those updates are provided below.

 - tpl file
   - 2 new options for bias estimation.
      - (5) Splines, which requires a new argument defining the knots.
      - (6) Linear interpolation between knots, which requires a new argument
        that defines the knots.
   - Changes the calculation of the best true age because the previous way
     led to strange plots.
   - Improvement to effective sample size calculation.
 - dat file
   - Read in one data set with missing entries, where there are no double
     reads. In the 2011-based code it allowed for reading in of multiple data
     sets.
   - Increased estimation speed because of how missing values are treated.
 - R files
   - Includes code to simulate data.
   - Includes a function to format input data from a csv with readers in
     columns and double reads in the rows.
   - Plot standardized outputs from the output file. These figures could still
     use some development.
   - Ability to step through multiple runs and catalog the output using the
     new `StepwiseFn()` function.
