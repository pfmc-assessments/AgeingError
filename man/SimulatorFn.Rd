\title{Simulate double reading data}
\usage{
SimulatorFn(
  Nreaders,
  M,
  SelexForm,
  ErrorParams,
  BiasParams,
  SelexParams,
  ReadsMat,
  RecCv = 0.6,
  RecAr1 = 0.8,
  Amax = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Nreaders}{The number of ageing readers}

\item{M}{True natural mortality}

\item{SelexForm}{Form of selectivity-at-age
(logistic selex-at-age is the only one that is implemented).}

\item{ErrorParams}{Error type
CV in the following equation:  Var[AgeRead] = (CV*TrueAge)^2}

\item{BiasParams}{Bias type
b in the following equation: E[AgeRead] = b*TrueAge}

\item{SelexParams}{Selectivity parameters, which
are standard to the logistic equation.}

\item{ReadsMat}{Matrix describing number of reads per reader combination.
Where each row specifies how many reads (in the first column)
have a particular pattern of double reads
(in the second through Nreaders+1 columns).}

\item{RecCv}{CV of recruitment, and it shoudl be noted that
recruitment is assumed to be stationary over time.}

\item{RecAr1}{First-order autoregressive coefficient for recruitment}

\item{Amax}{True maximum age}
}
\value{
Returns a simulated double read matrix
}
\description{
A function to generate simulated double reading data with given properties
}

# Parameters for generating data

  # Row 2 -- Otoliths read only once by reader 2
  # Row 4 -- Otoliths read twice by reader 2
  # Row 5 -- Otoliths read once by reader 1 and once by reader 2
